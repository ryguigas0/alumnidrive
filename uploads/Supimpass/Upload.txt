A lion does not flinch at laughter coming from a hyena.

You will meet a lot of people in your life; some laugh with you, others will laugh at you; some will love to clean your mess, others will love to mess you up! Love all, but choose carefully the one who stays close to you forever

It is very normal for one ugly weed to not want to stand alone.

When you are mocking somebody,
you are just trying to get rid of something embarassing within you
that makes you doing so.
